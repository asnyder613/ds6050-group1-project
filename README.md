# DS6050 Group Project: Pedestrian Detection

ABSTRACT: Pedestrian safety is an issue of critical proportions in the U.S. Recent estimates from the Governor’s Highway Safety Association (GHSA) report “that drivers struck and
killed at least 7,508 people walking in 2022 – the highest number since 1981 and an average of 20 deaths every day [1].” The aim of this project is to develop an efficient and accurate pedestrian detection model using deep learning techniques with the hope that such a model could be applied to a full pedestrian detection system with wide application–from additional safety warnings in current-model vehicles, to the future development of autonomous vehicles, and even surveillance systems–with the goal of improving pedestrian safety and making a significant reduction in the number of pedestrian deaths in the U.S. Specifically, the project focuses on training an object detection model on the EuroCity Persons (ECP) and CalTech Pedestrian data sets.
